## The following projects illustrate my JavaScript learning progress and journey:

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game 
The “Number Guesser” project involves creating JavaScript functions to power a guessing game where a human competes against a computer. The game generates a random target number each round, and both the human and computer make guesses. The functions determine which guess is closest to the target, update scores, and advance rounds. The project integrates JavaScript with HTML/CSS to create an interactive web-based game.
